# ModularPeripherals - WIP

**ModularPeripherals** is a light-weight script for your Minecraft computers.

This script is built to be **modulable** and **tweakable**. This means that features are meant to be deactivated and or/modified **on the fly** through commands or configuration files.

This repository also serves as a demo of the possibilites offered by the **CC:Tweaked** and **Advanced Peripherals** mods.
